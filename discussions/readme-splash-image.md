- An image of a vast, mysterious universe, with one or more planets or stars in the foreground and the vast, swirling galaxies in the background, representing the theme of exploring the universe and gaining insight into its mysteries.
- An image of a person looking through a telescope, symbolizing the search for truth and understanding through scientific exploration.
- A montage of images, representing the different themes explored in the book, including AI, the universe, and the relationship between humanity and technology.
- An abstract, surreal depiction of the universe, with swirling galaxies and stars, representing the vastness and mysteries of the universe and the existential questions explored in the book.
- These are just a few suggestions, feel free to choose a splash image that resonates with you and reflects the themes of the book.

# Prompt
I think these options might be a little too on-the-nose. What about something a little more subtle?

# Response
Sure! Here are a few more subtle options for a splash image for the README:
- An image of a single eye, symbolizing the idea of gaining insight and understanding. The eye could be partially obscured by shadows or reflections, hinting at the mysteries and complexities explored in the book.
- An image of a starry night sky, with a single bright star shining in the center, symbolizing the search for knowledge and truth. The star could be surrounded by a halo of light, further emphasizing the idea of gaining insight and understanding.
- An image of a circuit board or other technology, with a single glowing light or circuit in the center, representing the theme of technology and AI in the book. The circuit board could be partially obscured by shadows or reflections, hinting at the complex and sometimes mysterious relationship between technology and humanity.
- An image of a labyrinth or maze, representing the idea of searching for answers and exploring complex themes. The maze could be partially obscured by shadows or reflections, further emphasizing the idea of exploring mysteries and complexities.
- An abstract image of the universe, with swirling galaxies and stars in the background, and a single, glowing light in the foreground, symbolizing the idea of gaining insight into the mysteries of the universe.

These options provide a more subtle visual representation of the themes explored in the book, while still hinting at the complexity and mystery that lies at the heart of the story.

# Prompt
I really like the maze idea. Can we introduce to that image idea some sort of imagery regarding eyes or vision? Not too much, just a touch to tie into the title.

# Response
Yes, sure! Here's an idea for incorporating eyes into the labyrinth or maze image:

- An image of a labyrinth or maze, with the path through the maze leading to a single eye at the center. The eye could be partially obscured by shadows or reflections, representing the idea of exploring and gaining insight into mysteries. The background could be a starry night sky or an abstract representation of the universe, tying into the themes of technology and the vastness of the cosmos.

This option provides a subtle nod to the book's title, while still emphasizing the idea of exploring complex themes and gaining insight. The combination of the maze and the eye creates a visual metaphor for the journey through the story and the idea of gaining new perspectives and understanding.

# Prompt
Can we turn the eye into some sort of metaphor or reference that hints at an eye but isn't literally an eye?

# Response
Yes, definitely! Here are a few ideas for incorporating a subtle reference to eyes into the labyrinth or maze image:

- An image of a labyrinth or maze, with a bright light or star at the center. The light or star could be shaped like a lens, symbolizing the idea of seeing or gaining insight. The background could be a starry night sky or an abstract representation of the universe, tying into the themes of technology and the vastness of the cosmos.
- An image of a labyrinth or maze, with a single glowing circuit or technology at the center. The circuit or technology could be shaped like a lens or an eye, representing the idea of seeing or gaining insight. The background could be a starry night sky or an abstract representation of the universe, tying into the themes of technology and the vastness of the cosmos.
- An image of a labyrinth or maze, with a single beam of light shining out of the center. The beam of light could be shaped like a lens or an eye, representing the idea of seeing or gaining insight. The background could be a starry night sky or an abstract representation of the universe, tying into the themes of technology and the vastness of the cosmos.

These options provide a subtle reference to eyes or vision, while still emphasizing the idea of exploring complex themes and gaining insight. The use of the labyrinth or maze imagery creates a visual metaphor for the journey through the story, and the lens or eye shape symbolizes the idea of gaining new perspectives and understanding.
