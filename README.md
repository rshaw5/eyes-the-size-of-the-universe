# Welcome to "Eyes the Size of the Universe"
Welcome to the collaborative project for "Eyes the Size of the Universe," a sci-fi and existential themed book exploring themes of perception, existence, and the relationship between humanity and technology. Join us as we showcase the collaboration between human and AI, using GitHub to track the evolution of the text and document our creative process. Follow along as we delve into the vastness of the universe and confront the mysteries of reality and existence.

# Background
Sometimes, we all get hit with "oh that would be a good book title" thoughts. That's what happened with "Eyes the Size of the Universe". Here is my first prompt for this project that came to me from whatever place from which human creativity comes: "Can you give me a few book pitches for a sci-fi and existential themed book called 'Eyes the Size of the Universe'?". Everything past this seed of an idea has been created in collaboration with AI.

# Note
Please note that, by the nature of the AI tools I have access to and of collaborative work itself, I can't (and will not try to) record absolutely everything I discuss/work on with AI tools. This is a project that is edited and produced by a human being; with all the issues, blind-spots, and biases that entails.
